# BCG Data Science & Advanced Analytics Virtual Experience Program
## The Forage Virtual Experience

## Overview
Our client for this project is PowerCo, a major utilities company. PowerCo has had declining profits due to significant customer churn. We have been engaged to drive churn reduction within their Small & Medium Enterprise (SME) customers.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
We performed an initial EDA of the datasets comprising: 
- Historical customer data: Customer data such as usage, sign up date, forecasted usage etc
- Historical pricing data: variable and fixed pricing data etc
- Churn indicator: whether each customer has churned or not

An initial hypothesis was set to address our client's issue, in which we believed that price sensitivity played a major role in churn rates.

We were able to accept this hypothesis and found that 10% of the customer base churned within a 3 month timespan.

### Feature Engineering & Predictive Model

Using the information gathered from the initial EDA, we further cleaned the datasets and created additional features to help create an accurate predictive model.
While our random forest model had a high level of accuracy and precision, the recall score was not accepted. We determined that while the data shows high price sensitivity, we would need to further look into more features and data to provide conclusive evidence that fully proves the hypothesis.
